ER diagram: minimum of 3 entities, 2 relationships (at least one many to many
relationship) (20 points)
❑ List of relations derived from the ER diagram, with primary keys, foreign keys,
attributes (10 points)
❑ All Create table statements; one table must include an auto incremented column
(10 points)
❑ At least 8 insert, 1 delete and 1 update statements (5 points)
❑ 2 select queries involving an aggregate operation (4 points)
❑ 2 select queries involving a group by clause (4 points)
❑ 2 select queries involving a having clause (4 points)
❑ 2 select queries involving a join with 2 tables (4 points)
❑ 2 select queries involving a join with 3 or more tables (4 points)
❑ 2 nested select queries involving 2 tables (5 points)
❑ 2 nested select queries involving 3 or more tables (5 points)
❑ 2 nested select queries involving 2 or more tables and an aggregate operation (5
points) 80
❑ Important note: for each query above, you should include the SQL query itself
and an English phrase describing the query
❑ One HTML web page with a text field for user input
❑ One PHP script called by the HTML page, taking into account the user input, and
returning and outputting a JSON in a new page. The PHP script builds an SQL
query that should involve at least 2 tables. The JSON must include at least 3
objects and at least an array that contains at least 3 values. Either one of the object
must contain the array, or one of the array values must be an object. (20 points for
a group of 2 or 3, 12 points for a group of 4). You must defend against SQL in
jection.
❑ (Group of 3 or 4): Another HTML page with several text fields (or whatever user
input widgets you think is appropriate), and one corresponding PHP script called
by the HTML page, taking into account the user inputs, and inserting a row of
data in one of the database tables (having a minimum of 3 columns; thus, there
should be a minimum of 3 user inputs). The PHP script returns and outputs a
JSON. The JSON is a simple object that tells if the insert was successful or not. (0
point for a group of 2 or 3, 8 points for a group of 4). You must defend against
SQL in jection.
